#  The "What?, why? and how?" 
 A collection of configs (aka "dot-files") and useful scripts that I used to setup my Kali-Liunx. 
 It is purely set to maximize productivity while doing things on the terminal.
 The setup completely adores minimalism, therefore not every config here is > 50 lines (or bigger).

I don't use vim to write big projects (or never will I get involved in any) , but setting it up helps me since I use it everyday for the tiny scripts I write.
